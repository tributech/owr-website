# Create a Tournament

To host a tournament on OWR, click **Host Tournament** in the sidebar (or the button in the top nav bar). This opens the creation form where you'll set up the basics before diving into detailed configuration.

## AI-Powered Setup (Optional)

At the top of the form you'll see a drag-and-drop zone for your **player pack PDF**. Drop your pack in here and OWR will attempt to extract tournament details (name, points, rounds, dates, etc.) automatically. This is entirely optional — you can fill everything in by hand.

## Tournament Thumbnail

Upload an image (PNG, JPEG, or WEBP, up to 10 MB) to serve as your event's cover art. This appears on tournament listings and the event page header.

## Venue Location

Start typing in the **Location Search** field and select a result to auto-fill the address fields. You can also enter the address manually:

- **Street Address**
- **City / Suburb**
- **State**
- **Country**
- **Postal Code**

The venue shows up on a map on your tournament's public page, helping attendees find the event.

## Creating the Draft

Once you're happy with the basics, hit **Create Draft Tournament**. This creates the event in **Draft** status — it won't be visible to the public until you publish it. You'll land on the **Overview** tab where you can continue configuring scoring, rounds, staff, and more before going live.
